						<p class='about-text'>This page I will tell you about myself. I have been taking self-learning courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have learned to code from online courses from Codecademy, Code School, and Lynda.
I love to play videos games and I am really enjoying learning to code, and I really like to code and found it interesting. I am looking into learning more coding languages as I would like to be a Web Developer one day.
							<br>
							<br>
							I have worked in Technical & Customer Service Support for about 10 plus years now. My first job was a Minor Service Technician for a Honda Dealership. Then, I went to Hertz Rental Car as a Service Technician, after a few years of small jobs and moving around. I started a career in Techincal Support in Call Centers. I have worked for companies such as Dell, Electronic Arts, Blizzard, Google,  and Samsung. I am now looking for a career as a Front End Developer.
